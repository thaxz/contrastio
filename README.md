# contrast.io

Contrastio was my first contact with Swift. I've learned the basic functions and tried to translate my knowledge to a modified calculator.

Contrastio calculates the contrast ratio between two colors following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

Contains a simple interface, where the users can put the RGB code of the colors that they want to calculate and updates simultaneously, showing what color it is.

After that, will perform the contrast formula and return a score, based on WCAG.
